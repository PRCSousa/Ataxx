# Ataxx-Project

Attaxx is an abstract strategy board game and also a strategy video game that was published in
arcades by The Leland Corporation in 1990 with the name Ataxx . It also appeared the same year as
Spot: The Video Game and later as the Microscope Puzzle from the 1993 CD-ROM game The 7th Guest.
The game was invented by Dave Crummack and Craig Galley in 1988 and was originally called Infection.
It was first programmed on Amiga, Commodore 64, and Atari ST. Although Ataxx was originally sold as
a video game and not with a physical game board it is also an abstract strategy board game that may be
played with a physical board. Several online Attaxx online games are available such as for DosBox.
Figure 1 shows the original game and an Attaxx online game.

This project pretends to implement a simple AI algorithm that allows the computer to play the game against
the player, with possibility to change difficulty, maps and various other features that are yet to come.

Development notes can be read on the Jupyter Notebook in the files.
